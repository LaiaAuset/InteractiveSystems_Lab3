This game is using as a part of the interactive mode your nose. The goal is to touch every pink rotating cubes while the counter increments with a maximum of nine points. I have implemented some music and sounds to make the game even more fun, so turn up the volume in your computer. 

At first, in the Scene mode, it does not appear the cubes and the nose position due to the plane position, but in the game mode, you can see clearly that the plane is the background of the game and you can play it without any problem!
